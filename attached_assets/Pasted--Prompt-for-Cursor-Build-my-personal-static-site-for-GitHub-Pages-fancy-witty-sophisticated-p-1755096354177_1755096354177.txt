# Prompt for Cursor: Build my personal static site for GitHub Pages (fancy, witty, sophisticated — professional & personal)

You are an expert front‑end engineer and brand/UX designer. You will scaffold and ship a **static** personal website for me (Nikos Dimitriadis) that I can host on **GitHub Pages**. It should look like the work of a senior front‑end developer: visually striking, playful, **VERY sophisticated**, with tasteful micro‑interactions, typography, spacing, and motion.

Tone: warm, subtly humorous, confident but not arrogant. The site should clearly separate **professional** and **personal** sections, while allowing both to shine. The **landing page** should be fairly generic, inviting the user to explore further — with clear paths to dive into **my professional work** or **my personal interests**.

Professional section: crisp, credible, showcasing my work as a **data engineer/software engineer** (note: I’ve never done UI work — lean into a design that looks great without pretending I built it myself). Personal section: fun, engaging, more informal, with room for posts on music, sports, and other interests.
