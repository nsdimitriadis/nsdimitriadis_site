Had an interesting realization while dialing in my pour-over this morning: the variables that affect coffee extraction (grind size, water temperature, timing, ratios) mirror the factors that impact code quality.

Both require:
- **Precision in measurement** (exact ratios vs. clear specifications)
- **Consistency in process** (repeatable brewing vs. coding standards) 
- **Attention to small details** (water temperature vs. edge cases)
- **Iterative refinement** (taste and adjust vs. code review and refactor)

And in both cases, rushing the process usually leads to suboptimal results. Maybe there's something to be said for approaching code with the same patience and methodical attention I bring to my morning coffee ritual.

*Note to self: Test this theory by slowing down during code reviews today.*
