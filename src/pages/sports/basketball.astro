          Basketball is the sport I trained in most seriously. I knew there were physical limits I didn’t naturally have for the highest levels—but I loved the craft, the discipline, and the team rhythms of the game.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The Court</h2>
        <p>
          I started around age 9–10 at one of Thessaloniki’s best academies—<strong>Iraklis</strong>—where coaches like <strong>Maltezos</strong> drilled the fundamentals. At 15, I moved to <strong>Keravnos Agiou Pavlou</strong>, a local club that gave me more minutes and responsibility. Coach <strong>Tzamelis</strong> was relentless and passionate; he shaped me as an athlete and accelerated my physical development at a critical age.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Experiences</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A deep youth-league run with Keravnos—knocked out unfairly in the Round of 8 in Thessaloniki’s ultra-competitive league.</li>
          <li>Nearly a decade of club basketball before stepping away from formal training at 19.</li>
          <li>Rediscovering the game today purely for fun—pick-up runs, shooting sessions, and the love of it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Strategy & Skill</h2>
        <p>
          Basketball taught me structure and spacing, timing and patience—how small edges add up over four quarters. It also taught humility: understanding roles, trusting teammates, and embracing the grind even when the ceiling isn’t the highest.
