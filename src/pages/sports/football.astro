          Football has always been my first sporting love. As a kid I dreamed of becoming a footballer, winning the school league, and getting better every season. I played for All Stars FC for a couple of years around age eight, then drifted into basketball—but the love for football never left.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The Beautiful Game</h2>
        <p>
          My connection to the game is tied deeply to <strong>PAOK</strong>, my club from Thessaloniki. Following PAOK shaped how I watch, think about, and enjoy football—the tactics, the drama, the community. Off the pitch, I’ve poured thousands of hours into <strong>Football Manager</strong>, guiding PAOK, Brentford, Juventus, and Manchester United to Champions League glory. It’s half strategy, half obsession.
        </p>

        <h2>Favorite Moments</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Playing for the Computer Science faculty team at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki—first as a player, then a player/coach, and later as coach when the team started surpassing me.</li>
          <li>Watching PAOK’s big matches and feeling the city breathe with the team.</li>
          <li>Career-defining saves and late winners—on a real pitch and on Football Manager alike.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          Football is a teacher. It’s about patience, structure, and moments of brilliance—whether you’re coaching a uni team or simulating a dynasty in Football Manager. And about that team photo from uni? Don’t try to spot me—you’ll definitely fail.
