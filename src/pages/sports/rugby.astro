          I picked up rugby in August 2016 with the Thessaloniki Lions knowing almost nothing about the sport—other than that it was unique, fast, and gloriously physical. I was hooked immediately. What started as curiosity quickly became a way of life: teammates, community, and the grit of a contact sport that rewards discipline and respect.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The Game</h2>
        <p>
          I loved rugby’s combination of controlled chaos and structure: the collisions, the tactics, and the code of respect that binds rivals on the pitch. After a strong half-season with the Lions, I was approached to help start a new club. With a big circle of friends who were eager to try something different, we founded Rugby Rebels—where I served as founder, manager, and player.
        </p>

        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Aug 2016</strong>: Started with <em>Thessaloniki Lions</em>; fell in love with rugby’s unique, full-contact style.</li>
          <li><strong>2017 – 2019</strong>: Co-founded <em>Rugby Rebels</em> (founder, manager, player). Within six months we played our first tournaments, stacked up games, and earned our first wins.</li>
          <li><strong>2019 – 2021</strong>: Moved to Athens; played for <em>Panathinaikos</em> for a couple of seasons.</li>
          <li><strong>2021</strong>: Moved to London; played a few games with <em>Old Streetonians</em> and trained with <em>Hackney RFC</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>2022 & 2023</strong>: Attended <em>Flanders Open Rugby</em> with <em>Karatha Cavaliers</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>2025</strong>: Attended the <em>Aegean Rugby Festival</em> with <em>Cretan Gunners</em>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Moments</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Launching Rugby Rebels and seeing teammates wear the jersey for the first time.</li>
          <li>Our early tournament appearances and the buzz of earning those first wins.</li>
          <li>Playing festival rugby at Flanders with Karatha Cavaliers (2022, 2023).</li>
          <li>Joining Cretan Gunners for the Aegean Rugby Festival (2025).</li>
          <li>Experiencing the culture shift across clubs—Lions, Rebels, Panathinaikos, Old Streetonians, Hackney—same respect, new lessons.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Leadership</strong>: Starting a club taught me recruitment, organization, and accountability.</li>
          <li><strong>Resilience</strong>: You get hit, you get back up—simple rule, powerful mindset.</li>
          <li><strong>Respect</strong>: For teammates, opponents, and the game; it carries into everything else I do.</li>
        </ul>
